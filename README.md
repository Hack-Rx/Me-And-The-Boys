# Me-And-The-Boys
This is the MachineLearning Branch for our Application we are making for the "HackRx".

We have implemented a script to translate the messages in 'English' language.

An Instagram scrapper is developed to fetch the details of the instagram account from the metadata of any youtube video.

We will be tagging some of popular actors/figures as they come by in the video.
Apart from this, we are tagging frames with statuory warnings like 'Wear seatbelts','smoking and drinking warnings' and flagging 'NSFW' content.

The dataset used to train the model is found here https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sTeyTyN1tnv9cjhhlbqcuphffAuJQLws?usp=sharing
